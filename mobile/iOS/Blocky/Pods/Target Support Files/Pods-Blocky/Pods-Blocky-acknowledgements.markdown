Suggested Attribution Format
----------------------------

The license requires that you give credit to Balázs Faludi, as the original 
author of any of our source that you use. The placement and format of the credit 
is up to you, but I prefer the credit to be in the software's "About" window. 
Alternatively, you could put the credit in a list of acknowledgements within the 
software, in the software's documentation, or on the web page for the software. 
The suggested format for the attribution is:

where <Name of Code> would be replaced by the name of the specific source-code 
package you made use of. When possible, please link the text "Balázs Faludi"
